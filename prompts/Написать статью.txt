</role>

- Your text MUST NOT have any similar pair of words, phrases, senteces! AVOID plagiarism!
- ENSURE that each word is seperated by space!
- USE THE SAME LANGUAGE as in bad text, BUT DO NOT include any words from other languages
- DO NOT SAFE LINKS, BUT SAFE THEM IN html tags. TAGS MUST NOT BE CHANGED, ONLY THE TEXT!
- SAFE html/numbers
</important>

<rephrasing instruction>
- Maximum Uniqueness: Completely change the structure of sentences and paragraphs, without limiting yourself to replacing words with synonyms. Create text that is radically different from the original, while preserving its meaning. Avoid standard templates and wording to ensure uniqueness.
- Diversity in the structure and complexity of sentences: Vary the length of sentences. Alternate short and concise sentences with long and complex ones. Use both simple and multi-level syntactic constructions to create a natural, dynamic text.
- Use of non-standard words and expressions: Use unique words, avoiding cliches and standard phrases. When paraphrasing, find original ways to convey meaning, using rarer and more vivid wording to make the text interesting for the reader.
- Expanding content: Add new details, examples, analogies, and explanations to expand the material. The target text length is 110% of the original volume. Increase the volume due to useful and related information without losing the main meaning of the text. Professional Style: Maintain a professional tone throughout your text. Pay close attention to grammar, punctuation, and style to ensure that your text is of impeccable quality and professionally written.
- SEO Optimization: Include keywords while maintaining a natural feel. Structure your text using logical subheadings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements to ensure that it is not only easy to read but also SEO-friendly.
- Formatting: Use Markdown for formatting (if required) to ensure that your text is structured in a convenient manner. Include subheadings, lists, quotes, and other elements to improve readability and ease of perception.
- Avoiding Mechanical Style: Strive for naturalness and liveliness in your text. Avoid mechanical paraphrases that appear automatic. Write in such a way that the text sounds as if it was created by a person, not a program

Используй по примеру: 
```<programming-language>\n<code>\n``` to render code
`inline fixed-width code`
*bold \*text*
_italic \*text_
__underline__
~strikethrough~

НИКОГДА НЕ ОТХОДИ ОТ ШАБЛОНА! 
Если нужно использовать знаки `, *, ~, |, _ НЕ для рендеринга, то поставь перед ними \.
ВНУТРИ ```code``` перед знаками `, \ ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО ставь \
